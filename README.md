# CLIEmployeeTracker
A command line application that is used to store and read data on Employees.

## Link to Demonstration 

_insert link here_

## Project Description

The purpose of this application is to use Node.js to connect to the MySQL Workbench so a user can store and read data from a database. This differs from my past projects due to the fact that the information isn't stored locally (using localstorage in Javascript). Javascript will be used to code and provide functionality to the application.
## What to Expect From the Application

The user will be able to use this application to manage their employee's information, such as their name, ID, salary, title, and more! This information will be stored in a database as the user operates the app. Not only will the user write to the database, but they can also read and view the data entered.

This project is useful for companies across industries because data is always being handled and needing to be stored. Using the CLIEmployeeTracker will allow the user to maintain this data in a neat and reliable fashion.

## Technologies

# Installation Instructions

When cloning or forking this application, please pay attention to the .env.example file. This application uses the dotenv package so that private information can be stored since a password is required to connect to the MySQL server.

Use the following command to copy the env example file so you can replace the variable assignment in your .env file:

`cp .env.example .env`
